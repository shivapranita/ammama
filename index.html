          <h4>Dear Dabba <3,</h4>
          <p>On your special day, I just want to say how incredibly grateful I am to have you in my life. You are the kindest soul I know, and your smile is the prettiest thing in the world — it lights up everything around you. 💖</p>
          <p>You’ve always been there for me, no matter what, and I can’t imagine going through life without you by my side. You make every day brighter, and I'm beyond lucky to call you my macha. 🌟</p>
          <p>I hope this year brings you all the happiness you deserve, and may your heart be as full as you’ve made mine. Here’s to endless laughter, beautiful moments, and our unbreakable bond! Cheers to you, my amazing Mabbu! 🥂💐</p>
          <p>With all my love and admiration,</p>
          <h4>Avii</h4>
